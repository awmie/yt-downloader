## how to use it 

just copy youtube link and run this command via spotlight as `youtube downloader`(it will start showing up like this), and it will also open up the location it downloaded the video in mp4 format.

![shortcut](/shortcut_SS.png)
you can add quick keys(shown very right to the shortcut name appearing, just type your `quick key`) for say `ytd` so whenever you type `ytd` in spotlight it will run this shortcut.

### important:
![downloads_folder](/downloads_folder.png)

It will ask you for terminal and folder permissions as you're using it for the first time, allow it so it can download the video to the default location on your Mac that is set to `Downloads/` here.
It wont ask again after it is allowed.

### Advanced:
(only do if you know what you're doing)
> you can later edit the shortcut if you'd like, rename the shortcut or for example I changed my default Downloads/ folder locations to my custom folder path.
